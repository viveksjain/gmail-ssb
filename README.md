A (unofficial) SSB (site-specific browser) for Gmail. Created partly because [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com) doesn't give me enough control, and partly just to learn a little more about the WebKit APIs.

Features
--------
 - Shows downloads progress in Finder and the Downloads stack
 - Can handle mailto links (you can set it as your default email reader in Mail.app's settings)
 - Supports showing new mail notifications
 - Automatic updates via [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org)
